# A Novel Phase Frequency Detector for a High Frequency PLL
In this project I have implemented new phase frequency detector (PFD) which use only 10 transistors, whereas a conventional PFD uses 54 transistors. Prototype has been designed in Synopsys Custom Compiler  and implemented using 28nm technology with a supply voltage of 1.05V .The reset process has been completely removed in this design thereby eliminating the dead zone and speeding up the acquisition process reducing the delay in circuit. The design has been proposed for high speed, low power and low jitter applications.

## Introduction 
PLL circuits have a wide range of uses in modern communications, including
radios, telephones, cellular devices, Computers, as well as other devices. In mobile or
wireless communications, PLLs have many uses like synchronisation, clock synthesis,
and reducing jitter (Variation from its ideal position).

The power consumption in the PFD contributes to a significant part of the total power consumption of a PLL.
Therefore overall power consumption in a PLL can be reduced by minimizing the power consumption in PFD. The
main challenge in the design of PFD is to obtain very high operating frequency with minimal power dissipation. In this paper a novel PFD architecture is
proposed which is completely free from dead zone, dissipates very low power and operates at high frequency is given

## Circuit Design and Details

The Circuit Design consists of Two D-Flip Flops without reset .The design  design concentrates on eliminating reset delay so that the dead zones are completely
removed.The reset path is eliminated by adding pass transistor logic.Also, The design uses only 10 transistors which reduces power consumpumtion and overall area of the PLL Circuit compared to conventional PLL.

## Circuit Operation
![explanation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72538560/156037554-811cdf36-3c28-4f8c-ad4c-9323ae9f17bf.png)

Initially the CLKref and CLKvco signals are at logic zero. At the rising edge of CLKref, N1, N4 and N5 turns on and the UP signal goes to logic high. At the
rising edge of CLKvco, N2, N3 and N6 turn on forcing DN to go high. When both UP and DN are high, the logic
levels at points A and B in Fig. 3 are pulled down to logic zero making UP and DN to go to logic zero without any
delay for reset. 

## Simulation Waveforms 
Transient Response Analysis for the proposed circuit is shown below . From the fig it is clear that we provided a delay between both the inputs, when CLKvco is
lagging CLKref by 3ns, the UP signal goes high and vice-versa .Also,whenever both are high immediately both UP and DN signal go
down. The operational waveforms are similar to that of conventional PFD.
